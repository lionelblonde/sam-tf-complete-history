# Sample Efficient Imitation Learning

Write-up in progress.

ArXiv link: [Sample-efficient Imitation Learning via Generative Adversarial Nets]()

## How to launch?

Write-up in progress.

## TODOs

* Behavioral cloning pre-training
* Fix [UNREAL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05397.pdf) prioritized replay buffer
(need efficient sorted-insert)
